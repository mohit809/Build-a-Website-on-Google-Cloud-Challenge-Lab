(1)------  Copy and paste the following query into the query Editor, then RUN query to find which records are duplicated across all columns.

#standardSQL
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_duplicate_rows, * FROM
`data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`
GROUP BY
fullVisitorId, channelGrouping, time, country, city, totalTransactionRevenue, transactions,
timeOnSite, pageviews, sessionQualityDim, date, visitId, type, productRefundAmount, productQuantity,
productPrice, productRevenue, productSKU, v2ProductName, v2ProductCategory, productVariant, currencyCode,
itemQuantity, itemRevenue, transactionRevenue, transactionId, pageTitle, searchKeyword, pagePathLevel1, 
eCommerceAction_type, eCommerceAction_step, eCommerceAction_option
HAVING num_duplicate_rows > 1;
=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-----------------------Scenario: Your data analyst team has provided you with this query, and your schema experts have identified the
key fields that must be unique for each record per your schema.

-------------------------Run the query to confirm that no duplicates exist, this time in the all_sessions table:

#standardSQL
# schema: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en
SELECT
fullVisitorId, # the unique visitor ID
visitId, # a visitor can have multiple visits
date, # session date stored as string YYYYMMDD
time, # time of the individual site hit  (can be 0 to many per visitor session)
v2ProductName, # not unique since a product can have variants like Color
productSKU, # unique for each product
type, # a visitor can visit Pages and/or can trigger Events (even at the same time)
eCommerceAction_type, # maps to ‘add to cart', ‘completed checkout'
eCommerceAction_step,
eCommerceAction_option,
  transactionRevenue, # revenue of the order
  transactionId, # unique identifier for revenue bearing transaction
COUNT(*) as row_count
FROM
`data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
GROUP BY 1,2,3 ,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11,12
HAVING row_count > 1 # find duplicates
===========================================================================================================================================================================

--------------------------Write a query that shows total unique visitors
-----------------------your query determines the total views by counting product_views and the number of unique visitors by counting fullVisitorID.

----------Click "+" (Compose New Query) icon.

------------------------------Write this query in the editor:

#standardSQL
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS product_views,
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS unique_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`;

====================================================================================================================================================================
-----------------------------------Now write a query that shows total unique visitors(fullVisitorID) by the referring site (channelGrouping):

#standardSQL
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS unique_visitors,
  channelGrouping
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
GROUP BY channelGrouping
ORDER BY channelGrouping DESC;

==============================================================================================================================================================================

---------------------------------------------Write a query to list all the unique product names (v2ProductName) alphabetically:

#standardSQL
SELECT
  (v2ProductName) AS ProductName
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY ProductName


=============================================================================================================================================================================
Write a query to list the five products with the most views (product_views) from all visitors (including people who have viewed the same product more than once)
. Your query counts number of times a product (v2ProductName) was viewed (product_views), puts the list in descending order, and lists the top 5 entries:
Tip: In Google Analytics, a visitor can "view" a product during the following interaction types: 'page', 'screenview', 'event', 'transaction', 'item', 
'social', 'exception', 'timing'. For our purposes, simply filter for only type = 'PAGE'.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#standardSQL
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS product_views,
  (v2ProductName) AS ProductName
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE type = 'PAGE'
GROUP BY v2ProductName
ORDER BY product_views DESC
LIMIT 5;
====================================================================================================================================================================
Bonus: Now refine the query to no longer double-count product views for visitors who have viewed a product many times.
Each distinct product view should only count once per visitor:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH unique_product_views_by_person AS (
-- find each unique product viewed by each visitor
SELECT
 fullVisitorId,
 (v2ProductName) AS ProductName
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE type = 'PAGE'
GROUP BY fullVisitorId, v2ProductName )
-- aggregate the top viewed products and sort them
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS unique_view_count,
  ProductName
FROM unique_product_views_by_person
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY unique_view_count DESC
LIMIT 5
Copied!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tip: You can use the SQL WITH clause to help break apart a complex query into multiple steps.
Here we first create a query that finds each unique product per visitor and counts them once.
Then the second query performs the aggregation across all visitors and products.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===================================================================================================================================================================================
Next, expand your previous query to include the total number of distinct products ordered and the total number of total units ordered (productQuantity):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#standardSQL
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS product_views,
  COUNT(productQuantity) AS orders,
  SUM(productQuantity) AS quantity_product_ordered,
  v2ProductName
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE type = 'PAGE'
GROUP BY v2ProductName
ORDER BY product_views DESC
LIMIT 5;

=================================================================================================================================================================================
Expand the query to include the average amount of product per order (total number of units ordered/total number of orders, or SUM(productQuantity)/COUNT(productQuantity)):

#standardSQL
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS product_views,
  COUNT(productQuantity) AS orders,
  SUM(productQuantity) AS quantity_product_ordered,
  SUM(productQuantity) / COUNT(productQuantity) AS avg_per_order,
  (v2ProductName) AS ProductName
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE type = 'PAGE'
GROUP BY v2ProductName
ORDER BY product_views DESC
LIMIT 5;
Copied!
